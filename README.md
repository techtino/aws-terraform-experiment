# aws-terraform-experiment
This is me playing around with terraform, and doing some basic stuff like generating a vpc, subnets, route tables, ec2 instances from it.

To get started, you should just follow terraform upstream guides for AWS: https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started

This has some stuff specific to me so you'll want to do some edits, e.g. changing out the key pair for one of your own.
